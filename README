Sample OSGi Transaction Control Service implementation
------------------------------------------------------

This set of modules is a prototype implementation of the OSGi Transaction Control Service and related services, such as JDBC resource provision.

The Transaction Control Service (RFC-221) is an in-progress RFC publicly available from the OSGi Alliance: https://github.com/osgi/design/blob/master/rfcs/rfc0221/rfc-0221-TransactionControl.pdf

Given that the RFC is non-final the OSGi API declared in this project is subject to change at any time up to its official release. Also the behaviour of this implementation may not always be up-to-date with the latest wording in the RFC. The project maintainers will, however try to keep pace with the RFC, and to ensure that the implementations are compliant with any OSGi specifications that result from the RFC.
